## These are the theme files. You'll still need to install the Wordpress shell

## Local Wordpress Setup:

I use MAMP Pro with this setup: https://tppr.me/382Au.
The local URL is aliased to 'onea.wp'.
There's database dump from staging URL in this zip.
Search/replace if the url alias/database does not match the above.

Theme Workflow:

1.  Open theme directory: wp-content/themes/one-a
2.  Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies
3.  Run 'gulp --tasks' to view all tasks
